## Important information
The project is currently on hold. You are still able to download the legacy version and run it. But nothing changed in the code.

I won't give any support for the legacy version. A new version is on the way.

---

## My goal
A new and better version of the beloved tool SourceCraft to convert Minecraft maps into Source Engine maps.

I try to completely rework the program (currently in C#) and adding more features. You can help me via Pull Requests.

## Installation

If you just wanna use the programm, download the programm here: [SourceCraft-Reborn-Legacy](https://github.com/derLesh/SourceCraft-Reborn/releases/tag/v2.12)

If you want to contribute, create a fork of this project and publish it as a Pull request

## Texture Pack

Since there is no texture pack binded to this program you have to download it by yourself
